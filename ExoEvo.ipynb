    "Planetary interiors cool over time. As they cool, their interiors become more and more **viscous** (resistant to flow). At some point in a planet's lifetime, mantle **convection** becomes so inefficient that **conduction** becomes the dominant mode of heat transport through the planetary interior. A strictly-conductive planet can be considered geologically dead, since only convection enables large-scale geochemical cycling and delivery of fresh material to planetary surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "A planet's cooling rate depends on its heat **sources and sinks.** Sources include the exponential decay of radionuclides, any gravitational energy released as heat during accretion and differentiation, and heat generated from tidal dissipation. The mode by which heat is most efficiently transferred (convection or conduction) controls the efficiency with which that heat can be emitted, thus guiding the sink term.\n",

However, most detected rocky exoplanets orbit M-dwarf stars, which mature and brighten almost imperceptibly over billion-year timescales. Around such a long-lived star, an exoplanet's interior could experience a much wider range of internal temperatures and dynamical regimes. **A more dynamic approach may help to identify more subtle variations within and between exoplanetary thermal evolution pathways.** In addition, planets whose internal composition drastically differs from Earth's will likely behave differently in both a thermodynamic and rheological sense.\n",

    "* Without any external forcings, how long could a temperate-surface rocky planet remain geologically active?\n",
    "* How sensitive are planets of a given bulk composition to varying initial conditions, e.g. radionuclide abundance or starting temperature?\n",
    "* How do planets of differing composition respond to the same initial conditions? When do their thermal histories tend to converge or diverge?\n",
    "* If we want to probe a planet's history for external forcing events... what minerals (and associated stellar refractory element ratios) would allow for a given thermal regime at a given planetary age?\n",
    "* Alternatively, to test if planet and stellar properties are correlated... what minerals and radionuclide abundances would allow for a given thermal regime at a given planetary age? Are those compositions reasonable and consistent with stellar refractory element ratios?\n",
